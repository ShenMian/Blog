# 1.3

## Three-pass approach

1. To get a general idea of the paper. (5-10 mins).
   1. Read the **title**, **abstract** and **introduction**.
   2. Read the section and sub-section **headings**.
   3. Read the **conclusions**.
   4. Scan the references to see which ones you have already read.
2. To understand the content but **not** the details. (1 hour)
   1. Read the paper with greater care.
   2. Ignore details.
   3. Note down the key points as your read.
   4. Look carefully at the figures / diagrams.
   5. Highlight / note down relevant unread references for further reading (good for more background readings).
3. To understant the paper in depth. (1 to 5 hours)
