The two diagrams illustrate the expected development of an industrial region in the town Norbiton.  
Overall, this area will completely be converted into a residential block, with amenities and more roads to be established.  

In the first map, a river running from the west to the east is in the north, north of which is framland but on the other side is the industrial area.
In the middle, there is a roundabout with two exits, one of which links to a main road in the south and the other is oriented to the east, and some factories are arranged around the roundbout. In the west of the industrial area, it is the town.  

Turning to the second, a new exit to the north and connecting a road in front of some houses is likely to be added to the roundabout, and by then the farmland will shrink.
On the west of it, there will be a few houses and shops while on the east, besides a playground to be constructed in a newly built residential area, a medical centre will also be in place.  
In the far east, a school is planned. On the main road, a new roundabout will be installed there, connecting the one in middle.
