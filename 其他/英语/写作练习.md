The two diagrams illustrate(阐明) the expected development of an industrial region in the town Norbiton.  
Overall, this area will completely be converted into a residential block, with amenities and more roads to be established.  

In the first map, a river running from the west to the east is in the north, north of which is farmland but on the other side is the industrial area.
In the middle, there is a roundabout(环状交叉路) with two exits, one of which links to a main road in the south and the other is oriented to the east, and some factories are arranged around the roundbout. In the west of the industrial area, it is the town.  

Turning to the second, a new exit to the north and connecting a road in front of some houses is likely to be added to the roundabout, and by then the farmland will shrink.
On the west of it, there will be a few houses and shops while on the east, besides a playground to be constructed in a newly built residential area, a medical centre will also be in place.  
In the far east, a school is planned. On the main road, a new roundabout will be installed there, connecting the one in middle.

### Topic

It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives and their personal lives.  
Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweight the disadvantages?  

### Answer

We are going to make choice and face the risks in our works or even in our daily lifes. Some people like to taking
risks, but I perfer to take things step by step.  
It makes me feel more confortable if things are under control.  
Taking to much risks on some thing will make me nervous, I may spend too much time to think about this thing.  
Too many energy will be waste beacuse of it.  

Event I don't like to take risks, but I have to admit that there are also several advantages to take risks.Sometimes, we have to take risks if you want something done.  
People always say "more risks you take, more money you get", but you can also loose more money because of taking high risks.  
There are some advantages about taking lower risks. If I want to complete a task, take lower risks will make the
progress more stable and I will have more chance to get the task done in time. I think is important for things that have to finish in time.  
Taking riaks usually means cause more errors and that I not a good thing for our work or daily lifes.  

Overall, I think taking risks have more disadvantages than advantages. So I perfer to make choose which is less riskly. And then I will have more time to work on the task instead of ~~worring~~worrying about the risk itself.
